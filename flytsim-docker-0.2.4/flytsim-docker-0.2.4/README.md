# FlytSim as a Docker App

This project deals with dockerization of FlytSim App for easy deployment in any docker supported Linux, Windows and Mac environments.

## What is FlytSim?

FlytSim offers a 3D SITL(Software In The Loop) simulation environment for testing user apps without the drone hardware. It is a ROS-Gazebo based environment(valid only for PX4-SITL) where the drone and its world are simulated, programmatically generating the state variables, while the control algorithms applied are same as onboard the drone.

Please refer to http://docs.flytbase.com/docs/FlytSim/docker.html, for more details.
